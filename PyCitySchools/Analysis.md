We are provided with data for schools & students in a particular district which are divided into 2 data sets : school_data, student_data. From these we need to draw out conclusions based on mathematical caluculations.

DISTRICT SUMMARY:
. There are a total of 15 schools in the district, overall passing rate for these schools is less than 70. The Average Math & Reading score along with the passing on these are much better & all 4 are above 70.

SCHOOL SUMMARY:
. There are total 15 schools in the district which include 2 types of schools : district & charter. Bailey High School has the maximum number of students & Holden High School has the least number of students.
. The per school capita spending for each student is the highest for Bailey High School & minimum for Wright High School.
. The highest school math & reading score is Bailey High School for both. 
. Althought if you look at the highest overall passing % it is Caberra High School & lowest passing & is Rodriguez High School.
. When the spending range is less the Average math & reading score also the overall passing % is also much higher, when spending range is more the Average     math & reading score also the overall passing %  is lower.
. If the school size is small the overall performance is better compared to large school.
We perform various calulations from 9th to 12th graders, based on math scores, reading scores. then on the basis of budget/spending on each student, then determine if the school is small, medium or large based on budget. 

ANALYSIS:
The overall results of Charter school are better than district school results, in each category including the total passing percentage, also in individual catgories like math & reading.
